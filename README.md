## React Memory Game(Pokemon)
### Introduction
This project's goal is to practice react states and hooks.
Since pokemon resources are easily available, I choosed it as the theme of the project.<br>
The game will go through these steps:
   - Pick the number of cards that you'd like to play, the cards are randomly generated with diffrent pokemons each round!.
   - Calculate and display your score with each turn.
   - Display your total score with a message depending on your score.
